Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    # Check if the discount is 20% or higher
    if discount_percent >= 20:
        # Calculate the discount amount
        discount_amount = (discount_percent / 100) * price
        # Calculate the final price after applying the discount
        final_price = price - discount_amount
        return final_price
    else:
        # Return the original price if the discount is less than 20%
        return price

# Example usage
original_price = 100
discount = 25
final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount)
print("Final price after discount:", final_price)
